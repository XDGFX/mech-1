possible problem: steps are different for each axis; whereas time is not

maybe it should be in time (makes calculations easier) and just be accurate in terms of how far it will get in a given time

Then maybe correct if after if anything is off?

----

both axes have 'required steps'

longest distance is 'total steps'

available steps is total steps minus two times ramp (note: if longest does not reach full speed;
  then total steps = ramp steps therefore available steps = 0)

if required short steps is less than available steps, do stuff in the middle

if required short steps is greater than above, you can correct mid flight on one condition

steps required to correct (number of steps (of long distance) while slower one is ramping to get required delta steps due to the change in frequency)
is less than the available steps

all other cases do one at a time

Case 1:
Only one dimension
- Only move one dimension

Case 2:
Dimensions the same
- Move both dimensions at the same time

Case 3:
One dimension longer than the other

  Case 3.1:
  Longest dimension within ramp distance
  - Move one at a time

  Case 3.2:
  Longest dimension not within ramp distance, and shortest distance can be completed while other is on full speed
  - Move longest first, then adjust shortest while longest is moving

  Case 3.3:
  Longest dimension not within ramp distance, and shortest distance can not be completed while other is on full speed

    Case 3.3.1:
    Both can be ramped up and then correction can be made mid flight

    Case 3.3.2:
    Both can be ramped up but correction cannot be made mid flight
