both axes have 'required steps'

longest distance is 'total steps'

if required short required steps is less than total steps minus two ramps, do stuff in the middle

if required short steps is greater than above, you can correct mid flight on one condition

steps required to c


Case 1:
Only one dimension
- Only move one dimension

Case 2:
Dimensions the same
- Move both dimensions at the same time

Case 3:
One dimension longer than the other

  Case 3.1:
  Longest dimension within ramp distance
  - Move one at a time

  Case 3.2:
  Longest dimension not within ramp distance, and shortest distance can be completed while other is on full speed
  - Move longest first, then adjust shortest while longest is moving

  Case 3.3:
  Longest dimension not within ramp distance, and shortest distance can not be completed while other is on full speed

    Case 3.3.1:
    Both can be ramped up and then correction can be made mid flight

    Case 3.3.2:
    Both can be ramped up but correction cannot be made mid flight
